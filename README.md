## Customer Segmentation using RFM, KMeans, and Gaussian mixture model

 In this project, our main goal is to group the clients in customer segments by using a clustering technique. To do this, weâ€™ll be using K-Means, and Gaussian mixture models. However, how to group these clients? Which variables to use? We can try to analyse the customers by using the RFM (recency, frequency, monetary value) approach. This method is used to evaluate customer value, and deploy personalized strategies to attract them.
